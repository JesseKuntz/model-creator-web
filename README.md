# model-creator-web
Web component for the Model Creator system. This was first developed as a senior project at Calvin College. It's a developer tool right now, not a product, so keep that in mind. If you would like to see the app component, go here: https://github.com/JesseKuntz/model-creator-app

## Dependencies
* Git (but hopefully you have that already): https://git-scm.com/
* Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/

## Get Started

Clone the repo. Rename the .env-template file as .env, and follow the instructions in the file, filling in your own information in place of the dummy data.

After that, run:

`npm install`

Then, you can start the site up by running:

`npm start`

After that, visit the site at http://localhost:3000
