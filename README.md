# model-creator-web
Web component for the Model Creator system. This was first developed as a senior project at Calvin College. It's a developer tool right now, not a product, so keep that in mind. If you would like to see the app component, go here: https://github.com/JesseKuntz/model-creator-app

## Dependencies
* Git (but hopefully you have that already): https://git-scm.com/
* Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
* A Plotly.js account: https://plot.ly/Auth/login/?next=%2Fsettings

## Get Started

Clone the repo. Rename the .env-template file as .env, and follow the instructions in the file, filling in your own information in place of the dummy data.

Then, go to 'public/script.js' and replace the URL in the 'src' attribute of the iframe with the URL for your graph from Plotly. When you send the data over, it will tell you what the URL is in the terminal/console output.

After that, run:

`npm install`

Then, you can start the site up by running:

`npm start`

After that, visit the site at http://localhost:3000

## How it Works

COMING SOON.
